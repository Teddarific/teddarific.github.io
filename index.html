<div id="AboutMe" class="tabcontent">
  <h2> General </h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Teddy Ni, and I'm currenty a '19 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.
     Here at Dartmouth, I'm studying Computer Science and Economics, and maybe some math in the future.
     I'm originally from Barrington, Rhode Island, so as you may be able to tell I really like the north east.
  </p>

  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
  <p> One of my favorite hobbies is playing and watching soccer. I've grown up playing soccer, and still love to do so.
      I played both varisty and premier in high school, and now I play club in college. I mainly follow the Premier League,
      and am a huge fan of Arsenal F.C. My favorite player is Mesut Ozil, as I play as a central attacking midfielder myself!
      Some of my other favorite players of all time include Steven Gerrard and Toni Kroos.
  </p>

  <h2>Computer Science </h2>
  <p> Web development has become one of my foremost passions, and is something I've been doing more and more in my free time.
      Over this past summer, I began learning AngularJS and built my very first web app: a Connect 4 game. Then, over this past winter,
      I began learning Node.js and Express. Beyond Angular and Node, I have experience in HTML/JS/CSS, Socket.io, MongoDB/Mongoose,
      Jade, and Java. My favorite language is without a doubt JavaScript! I've also written unit tests in the Karma + Jasmine framework
      for a front-end web application at Dasault Systemes.
      Check out my Github profile in the Contact Me tab to see some of my work!
  </p>

  <h2>Aspirations</h2>
  <p>
    To be honest, I don't really know what I want to do in the future. My main short term goal, however, is to do my work
      in web development. I hope to learn the full MERN stack, and become a full-stack web developer! From there, I hope to
      transition into creating native React apps since I think the future lies in integrating web and iOS/Android apps. The dream
      is to start my own company.
  </p>

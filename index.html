      Hi! My name is Teddy Ni, and I'm currenty a '19 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.
      I'm originally from Barrington, Rhode Island and have lived there my whole life! At the moment, I'm up at campus
      taking classes and living the typical college student life!

    <p class="info"> Currently, I'm undeclared at Dartmouth. However, I'm most likely to declare as a Computer Science and
      Economics double major. There's also a possibility for data science to make an appearance somewhere
      down the line, as I'm greatly interested in data analytics.
    </p>
    <p class="info"> Some of my favorite computer science classes that I've taken so far include Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics.
      I greatly enjoy the theoretical side of computer science, and seeing the beauty of designing algorithms. Moreover,
      it was fascinating to see the application of uncertainty and probability into computer science. I'm looking forward
      to doing more work in the theoretical and mathematical side of computer science! Classes I intend on taking in the
      near future include Software Development and Machine Learning.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      In terms of Economics, I'm currently specifically studying International Finance. So far I've taken the staples
      of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, and am just starting to concentrate on International Finance.

      Over this past summer, I interned at Dassault Systemes. While at Dassault Systemes, I wrote unit tests in the
      JavaScript Karma + Jasmine framework for the front-end of a web application. Then, over this past winterim,
      I was invited back and worked on bug fixes for the front-end of the same web application. See my LinkedIn at the
      bottom of the page for full details!

    <p class="info"> Web development has become one of my foremost passions, and is something I've been doing more and more in my free time.
      Over this past summer, I began learning AngularJS and built my very first web app: a Connect 4 game. Then, over this past winter,
      I began learning Node.js and Express. Beyond Angular and Node, I have experience in HTML/JS/CSS, Socket.io, MongoDB/Mongoose,
      Jade, and Java. My favorite language is without a doubt JavaScript!
      Check out my Github profile at the bottom of the page!

    <p class="info">
      Outside of academics, I love playing and watching soccer. I've grown up playing soccer, and still love to do so.
      I played both varisty and premier in high school, and now I play club in college. I mainly follow the
      Premier League, and am a huge fan of Arsenal F.C. My favorite player is Mesut Ozil, as I play as a
      central attacking midfielder myself! Some of my other favorite players of all time include Steven Gerrard
      and Toni Kroos.

    <p class="info">
      To be honest, I don't really know what I want to do in the future. My main short term goal, however, is to continue with
      my work in web development. I hope to learn the full MERN stack, and become a full-stack web developer! From there, I hope to
      transition into creating native React apps since I think the future lies in integrating web and iOS/Android apps. The dream
      is to start my own company.
